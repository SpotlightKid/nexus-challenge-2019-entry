Another Day (Working Title)
---------------------------

Verse 1:

As the light
slips away
My mind is black
And I can't find the way

See the flame
Flash In The Night
Like a Maniac I pray


Chorus 2:

While you're so far away
There'll be another day
When you Come Back And Stay, and I
Won't Let You Down Again
I'm standing in the rain
And another lonely night Fades To Gray


Verse 2:

All the world
frozen white
Lady Of Ice
Where's my Lucky Star tonight

Hold Me Tight
Don't say a word
Loose my Self Control, but hey


Chorus 2:

You're, oh, so far away
I'll never see the day
When you come back to me and stay
Don't Break My Heart again
Cause I can't stand the pain
It's a losing game which I don't wanna play


Chorus 3:

(Chorus 1)


Chorus 4:

(Chorus 2)
