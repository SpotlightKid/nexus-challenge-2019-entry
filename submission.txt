Description
-----------

This track is an homage to Italo Disco, and more specifically to the songs
*Valerie Dore - The Night" and "Laura Brannigan - Self Control". There are a
few nods to other tracks from the era and in the last part I up the cheese
factor a notch and veer straight into 70s disco.

All instruments and drums were created in software, the recording part was
the tracking of the vocals, which are performed by Julia Cramer (with some
background vocals by me added later as well).
